# Xtern-Work-Assessment-Sample
An analysis on posible locations for Xtern coworking space

Based on the data, the best choice of coworking location is Launch Indy. The location is in the heart of downtown, and is, on average less than 5 miles from all the possible points of interest in Indiannapolis. While the commute time is slightly longer when compared to Industrial MAss Ave, it is more convenient for people who do not have cars. I have included an itinerary for the 10 week program, as well as a bar graph showing average commutes for eaxh location. The itenerary is based on the bi-weekly criteria, as well as ratings and accessibility. The schedule is still relative tentative, as there is not much information available yet on events happening from May through July.
